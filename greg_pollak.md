12 Steps to be a better developer (aside from the coding part)

technology alone is not enough - Steve jobs

good at coding is not enough to be a good software developer.

1. Set expectation. Transparency

Bring the client closer to the team. We devs are not good at communicating. Every weekly estimates, and calls every monday. End of the week they send the hours worked.

2. Be mindful of your engineering background.

Listen to Ideas. Diagnosing and telling them that their idea sucks kills collaboration. Diagnosis = Criticism. 
Practice saying "Yes, and" when brainstorming.

Give your full attention to somebody when they talk. 

3. Software Development is an art form (kinda.. is a craft).

Our job is to make beautiful work. Consulting is usually more challenging because you scratch somebody elses itch.

4. Learn how to delegate

Project Managers. Delegate stuff to others. Schedule meetings and such. Give stuff that you don't like to people that like to do it.
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

Do stuff that give you energy and delegate stuff that doesn't.

Do the MATH.

Barista that gives coffee to people without standing up. 
80 people average 1 cup a day. 15 minutes wasted. = 2000 minutes a day. 20 hours. What would you do with more time?

5. Continue to learn inside your company.

Pair programming. 
Book club - Meet once a week.
Code reviews - have some lunch and code review together.
Retrospective - taking an hour after a milestone. Talk about what went really well, or bad and how could we do it better.
Show and tell - People get together and show stuff they programmed or they like.
Betterment - Work on something that makes you better. Reading a book. Typing faster. Watching a video. Opensource.

6. Stay out of your comfort zone.
You do your best work when you're challenged. If not, you stop getting better. Embrace scary stuff.
Scary task probably teach you more. One simple solution: start with your most difficult tasks.

7. Make friends and build relationships.
Yes, to be a good software developer you need to be good at making friends. More friends = happiness = better work. 
How much time do you spend at work nurturing friendships.
People love talking about themselves.
Try to make 5 new people.
Looking for a job? friends = job.

8. Don't be afraid to ask for help
Human nature to not admit defeat and not ask help. Give yourself 30 minutes before asking for help. If something is taking too much time you are probably doing it wrong.
Who do you ask?
Preempt the problem - Pair programming to solve it!

9. Learn to eliminate distractions and get in the zone.
its not natural to be 100% production. Optimally: 80% prod and 20% fun.
Turn off communication. Alternative workspaces. Post-its are great! better than online.

10. Communicate better than everyone else.
Quality software = better communicator than coder. Hire great writers! Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking.
Force yourself to communicate. Be more effective with skitch (evernote). Jing is a screencasting tool. 

11. Remember what is really at stake. 
You will never have opportunity to do the same work again. 

12. Understand what will make you happy.
It's not money...
Its not fame...
it's not ONLY code...
Doing meaningful work.
