Inter-Application communication using secure API's
by Jon Dean

Code interfaces
Web APIs

Multiple Rails applications that need to share functionality.
Legacy admin application written in Django

Set up a restful API or do Gems. They made lots of gems to communicate :/ OMG

Sharing code via a GEMS

PROS
  Easy
  Abstract the work through code-level APIs
  Can cost less money
  No network latency
  No need to implement authentication

CONS
Need to update and deploy all applications when the gem changes.
Lots of code churn/branches
Internal improvements require a change in all applications using it.


PROS OF SHARING CODE VIA API SERVICE
Internal changes have no affect on client apps
Can independently scale the resource that deals with payments
Can add clients in any language to your systems

CONS
More complex
Costs money to run an additional application
Network latency
Handling timeouts and other service unavailability issues
Also need to implement an authentication layer
