How versus Why...
by Bryan Liles

Introduction

How is good
  Many conferences based on how to do robots, sinatra, ruby, rails...

Why do you test?
We forget you will not be the last person to see the code.
Why? because you care about coworkers and care that it works good.

Convention vs Configuration
How? Put things into a directory and it just works
Why? Easier

SOA
Why? Service oriented architecture. Little services talking to each other.
Pragmatic!
It multiplies many forces:
  Allows to not have everyone working on one huge system
  If you are doing inventory. You dont need to know everything from other systems.

Mac vs Everything Else
Why? Mac OS X is horrible. Expensive. Maybe because they are pretty? Power of Unix without all the dumbest of Windows.

RFC 2616 HTTP Protocol

Create awesome software
Software that understand the hardware and the users. 

How vs Why in Software Development.
How do we get more women in software development?
Why? Maybe they just dont wanna be here. Maybe It doesn't seem cool thing for women to do.

How vs Why in the Real World.
Want to be a better developer? Code like Indiana Jones.
Dont be scared to share it with everybody. No such thing as bad code.
Why the legacy code you work for is so bad? There might be problems with constraints.

Why > How
More $$$ == More Success

Understanding builds trust
More trust == More speed
More understanding == More speed
More speed == More $$$
Understanding Why == More $$$
