Object Oriented for Arduino

Design is to reduce the cost of change.
We need design principles.

SOLID
Single Responsability
Our objects and methods should only have one responsability.

Open-Closed
Open to extension but closed to modification

Liskov Substitution
If we inherit or we have a subclass. This class should be able to be replace a superclass

Interface Segregation
no is_a? responds_to?

Dependency Inversion
Less dependency is better. We can inject the dependency in the constructor.

DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself
We shouldn't duplicate behaviour.

Hardware is becoming a big deal.

Prototype Hardware is CHEAP
