* Githuh only answers email.
* 4 million users
* 300 new requests/day
* 550 replies/day
* 14 supportocats

Let's ship it our new code!

Good Bug Reports
------
  * Identify a bug (not user error, etc.)
  * Recreate a bug, document well
  * Include user data from support requests.

After shipping a new look for Github
------

* They had to sort a lot of bugs and complains and complaints and complaints
* Reports were emotional. Users who care are users who swear.
* Some people hated the new look so they wanted a way to put it back.
* And there were so many bugs. Designers/Developers don't need to see so many bugs. This can break morale.

Solution
------
* Make a Dossier (a gentle report) were all bugs are squashed.
* People don't like change. But stats tell if people REALLY don't like it. Hard to ignore.

Colorblind Reports
-------
Hits you right in the feels:

*"As a partially colorblind user, I find the new tags to be a lot more difficult to see"*

What they learned is that dog fooding doesn't give the majority.

The design team worked really hard for the new look. And they don't want to upset them.

**Trust that people actually have low ego**

Github hires employees that have low ego thus they are cool about these reports.

Two hours later: Github dev/designers understood without getting mad. The LOW AXE Dossier helped.

Go from beautiful to things that people CAN see!

Conclusion
------
* Excellent bug reports makes devs happy.
* If you have a support team consider how you work with them.
* Sonya doesn't know how to code. But still she can do good bug reports.
* Low ego == Fun people
