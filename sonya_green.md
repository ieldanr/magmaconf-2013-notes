Ship it.

GOOD BUG REPORTS
  identify a bug (not user error, etc.)
  recreate a bug, document well
  include user data from support requests.

How do you know if you change is good or bad?
Github hires low ego.

GitHub Issues

Sorting a lot of data bugs and bugs and complains and complaints and complaints
Data was emotional. Users who care are users who swear.

They hated the new look so they wanted a way to put it back.
So many bugs. Designers/Developers don't need to see so many bugs.

Fuck yeah. Dossier.
  Squash bugs - Gravatars not working
  
Stats tell if people dont REALLY like it. Hard to ignore.

Hits you right in the feels: "As a partially colorblind user, I find the new tags to be a lot more difficult to see"

Dog fooding doesn't give the majority.

Don't want to upset the design team.
Trust that people actually have low ego.

Two hours later: Github dev/designers understood without getting mad.
The LOW AXE Dossier helped.

Go from beautiful to things that people CAN see!

Excellent bug reports makes devs happy.
If you have a support team consider how you work with them.

Sonya doesn't know how to code.
low ego == fun people


When I'm losing my cool I turn to animated giffs.
