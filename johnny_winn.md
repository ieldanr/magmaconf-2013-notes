Building an Organic API
by Johnny Winn
from HashRocket

Everything is an API.

The why, what and how of APIs
Why should we care about our interfaces?
What can we learn about APIs frmo a DSL? 

Why?
Every object communicates through its public interface

Unintuitive interface impede communication!

What?
Adaptive Domain Language Interpreter
Focus is shifted to the messages
Implementation changes based on a dialect
Messages are transformed

Message-Driven Design

Message Dirve Design
Language adaptation with Dependency Injection
Abstraction of extenal dependencies via proxy
Visitor pattern to apply commands

Dependency Injection
Any instance of TARDIS you pass the dialect in!
You configure it with a file.

Proxy Pattern
Wrap, not Warp

Visitor Pattern
Add new functionallity to an existing object without modifying the original object

Verdict
Expose communication.

How?
Active Record is an intuitive interface
  Business objects are decoupled from data
  It responds to a common dialect

Messages should convey INTENT.
